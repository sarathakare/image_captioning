# Image Captioning
This repository focuses on image captioning using deep learning. 

## Overview

Image captioning combines computer vision and natural language processing. The primary goal is generate meaningful and relevant captions for a wide range of images.

## Features

- Utilizes ResNet for image feature extraction.
- Employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for caption generation.
- Trained on a diverse dataset of 8,000+ images and 40,000 captions.

## Dataset
- Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k).
- The don't contain any well-known people or locations, but depict a variety of scenes and situations.
